## Important Projects

- [**Sentiment Analysis**](./Sentiment%20Analysis)
  - Developed a fully reproducible sentiment classification pipeline using DVC and
  Docker. The project processes two distinct datasets, conducts EDA, employs
  multiple text vectorization techniques (BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec), and compares
  machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning

- [**Neural Networks for solving Ordinary Differential Equations**](./Neural%20Networks/Neural%20Networks%20for%20solving%20Ordinary%20Differential%20Equations)
  - Developed a Multilayer Perceptron model to solve ordinary differential equations
  by constructing a custom residual-based loss function and using automatic
  differentiation. Conducted performance analysis of activation functions

- [**Temperatures in Wrocław**](./Data%20analysis/Time%20series%20analysis/Temperatures%20in%20Wrocław)
  - Analyzed and fitted an ARMA model to historical average temperature data for Wrocław to identify trends and patterns.


- [**Hemodynamics Model**](./Partial%20Differential%20Equations)
  - Developed a model to simulate blood flow in vessels using partial differential equations derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. 


- [**Car Workshop Database**](./Databases/SQL%20Group%20project)
  - Designed and implemented a comprehensive database for a car workshop, encompassing schema design, data generation, analysis, and automated report generation.
