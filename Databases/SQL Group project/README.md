A database project for a car workshop, "Pimp My Wheels", consisting of 5 parts:

1) Database design – Create a schema for managing staff, equipment, vehicles, transactions, customers and more.
2) Data generation – Script realistic data for the database using tools like Python or Excel.
3) Data analysis – Analyze repair trends and profitable sales using the database.
4) Report – Present analysis in an automated PDF report.
5) Documentation – Include project details, technologies used, and instructions for running the project.

My work in this project mainly focused on subpoints 1 and 2, with contributions to all other parts as well.
